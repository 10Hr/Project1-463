Project 1
Hybrid and Adaptive Sorting Algorithms

PROJECT GOALS

In this project, students will explore and implement hybrid or adaptive sorting algorithms to improve the efficiency of the sorting process through piggybacking the existing sorting algorithms.
ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION

The algorithm I went with improving is hybrid quicksort. This algorithm combines both quicksort and insertion sort. Insertion sort is better when the array is small, so the algorithm uses insertion sort when the array is small enough. Otherwise, it uses quicksort.
How I improved this algorithm is firstly I improved the insertion sort by making adding making use a binary search within the sorted portion of the array to find the correct position to determine where to insert each element. This reduces the number of comparisons compared to a standard insertion sort. I improved the quicksort by making it a randomized pivot instead of just the highest value. 
Altogether my algorithm consistently performs better than the traditional hybrid quicksort. I call it Hybrid Adaptive Quick Sort as it uses elements from both a hybrid and an adaptive sorting algorithm.

BENCHMARKING RESULTS

The algorithm consistantly seems to be about .002 seconds fast in all cases
